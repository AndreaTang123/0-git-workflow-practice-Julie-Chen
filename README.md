With the growing use of AI, our careers and academics have drastically changed. On one hand, AI can enhance productivity and access to information. On the other hand, as this article demonstrates, it also introduces risks, particularly concerning the authenticity and integrity of academic work. It seems like the varying degrees of acceptance of AI in academic spaces reflect broader societal struggles with embracing and regulating new technologies. It is interesting—and a bit concerning—how these tools, while promising to streamline and innovate, also pose substantial threats to established systems.

I never thought of research papers now being written by Generative AI. Definitely something to watch out for. Hopefully Google Scholar can implement some quality control measures in the future to safeguard against AI-generated research and manipulated data.
